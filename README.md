## Working Extension List

A curated list of extensions that works for Android chromium browsers
The extensions are mainly tested on [Kiwi Browser](kiwibrowser.com) the only and first open-source browser for Android with extension support 
(I'm aware of Yandex, but is not open-source while thanks to Kiwi other browsers seem interested in implementing extension support)


### Contributing
All the data is managed through a JSON file ( dataWEL.json )

Keeping the list up to date is not easy and time-consuming, but if you want to contribute and update the
                list for the community , you're welcome
